          <p>Artist Finds Reprieve Being Deep, But Where?

            Local artist, Bob Ross (not the famous one, the other Bob Ross), has been struggling to find inspiration for his latest piece. He's tried everything - taking a walk in nature, listening to soothing music, even meditating - but nothing seemed to work.
            
            That is, until he stumbled upon a solution that he never would have thought of in a million years.
            
            Bob decided to bury himself in a hole.
            
            "I was digging a hole in my backyard for a new flowerbed, and I realized that being deep in the earth was incredibly peaceful," said Bob. "I felt like all of my creative juices were flowing again."
            
            Bob's newfound appreciation for the depths of the earth led him to create his latest masterpiece, an 8-foot-tall sculpture of a mole. "I never would have thought to make a mole sculpture if it weren't for my time spent underground," said Bob.
            
            The sculpture, which is made entirely of recycled materials, has been getting rave reviews from critics. "It's a beautiful and thought-provoking piece that really captures the essence of being deep, both literally and figuratively," said one art critic.
            
            But Bob's newfound passion for being deep has caused a bit of a problem at home. His wife, Susan, is not thrilled about the fact that her husband spends hours each day buried in a hole in their backyard.
            
            "I don't know what's come over him," said Susan. "He's always been such a normal guy, but now he's always talking about the 'subterranean world' and how he needs to 'connect with the earth.' It's driving me crazy."
            
            Despite the complaints from his wife, Bob has no plans to stop his underground escapades. "I've never felt more alive," said Bob. "Who knows, maybe next I'll dig a tunnel and see where it takes me."
            
            Bob's next project is a tunnel system made of recycled materials, he calls it the "Subterranean World". Susan is thinking of getting a divorce.
            
            As for Bob Ross, he's found his reprieve, but where it is, is anyone's guess.</p>
